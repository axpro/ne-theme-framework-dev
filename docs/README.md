# Next EUROPA Frontend Documentation


## Purpose

_Explain the purpose of the style guide._

## Generate

### Requirements

* Node.js >= v4
* npm >= v3.3.x
* Python 2.7

### Install build system

Before we can build the NextEurop a theme framework we need to install the build system
itself. This can be done using Node.js and npm:

```bash
npm install
npm run bower update
```

This will install Bower and Gulp locally as this is the only so far to make it build correctly on ContinuousPHP.

Note: if you have Phing installed globally, you can also use the command:

```bash
phing
```

### Live Style Guide

```bash
npm run dev
```

Phing alias:

### Build
